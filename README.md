# Medical Data Dashboard

This repository provides tools and a web application to analyze medical data, visualize patient vitals, and predict health risks using machine learning. The project aims to deliver an efficient solution for monitoring, analyzing, and predicting patient health status based on vital signs.

## **Features**
### **1. Streamlit Application (`app.py`)**
- **Patient Dashboard**: Displays patient details such as name, blood group, age, and weight.
- **Real-Time Data Visualization**: 
  - Line charts for vitals like heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature.
  - Adjustable timeframes (last 24, 12, 6, or 1 hour).
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summary metrics for all vitals (mean, min, max).
- **Health Risk Prediction**:
  - Input vitals to predict health status (`Critical`, `Risk`, `Healthy`) using a Random Forest classifier.

### **2. Machine Learning Model (`Model-Generation.ipynb`)**
- Trains a Random Forest Classifier using the dataset (`realistic_medical_data.csv`).
- Encodes health status labels (`Critical`, `Risk`, `Healthy`).
- Saves the model as `model.pkl` for deployment.

### **3. Sensor API (`sensor_api.py`)**
- Simulates real-time sensor data for vitals (heart rate, systolic/diastolic blood pressure, body temperature).
- Provides a patient data mock API.
